                <h2>Article 1</h2>
                <p>Liverpool were without a whole host of 
                    first-team stars as Jurgen Klopp began 
                    preparations for Everton - with both Emre
                    Can and Ragnar Klavan still unsighted.
                    With Thursday's session serving as a 
                    recovery to those who started in the 3-0
                    win over Manchester City, it gave an opportunity
                    for the likes of Danny Ings, Dominic Solanke, 
                    Nathaniel Clyne and Alberto Moreno to impress
                    at Melwood.

                    <h2>Article 2</h2>
                    <p>Injuries to Joe Gomez and Joel Matip mean the 
                        Reds are down to two fit centre-backs for the 
                        next few weeks, while Jordan Henderson will 
                        be suspended for the Champions League 
                        second leg clash with Manchester City.With 
                        Everton coming less than 72 hours after the 
                        physically and emotionally draining win over 
                        City, Klopp could be forced to reshuffle his pack 
                        at Goodison.

                        <h2>Article 3</h2>
                        <p>Jurgen Klopp believes the work Pep Guardiola 
                            has done in creating a team "capable of beauty 
                            and dominance" at Manchester City can drive his 
                            own team on to match, and hopefully surpass, 
                            the Spaniard's sparkling creation.City are close 
                            to breaking Premier League records for their dominance 
                            this season, with the potential to clinch the league 
                            title on Saturday with five matches still to spare.

                        <h2>Article 4</h2>
                        <p>But in his programme notes for tonight's Champions 
                            League quarter-final with City, Klopp explains 
                            how Guardiola can motivate him and his squad to 
                            improve even more. "I think it is now clear that 
                            Pep is making the same impact in England that he 
                            did in Spain and Germany, in terms of creating a 
                            team that is capable of beauty and dominance Pep 
                            is making the same impact.

                        <h2>Article 5</h2>
                        <p>"Pep raises the bar, but I think rather than 
                            just stand and applaud our job at Liverpool 
                            is to keep focused on what we are doing to give 
                            ourselves the chance to jump even higher. That's 
                            our job: worry about what we can affect, which is 
                            our own development as a team, and see where that 
                            takes us to."I look at our quality and I am excited
                            about what is achievable for Liverpool, both for 
                            the rest of this campaign and the ones to come."

                        <p>"I am someone who loves football. I have since being 
                            a very small child and I don't envisage that changing 
                            until my last breath is taken.. And what I love about 
                            football is that it offers all the most intense emotions 
                            and experience for the period of time the game is being 
                            played and we all get to experience it together.
