             <h3>Angular</h3>
             <p>HTML is great for declaring static documents, 
                 but it falters when we try to use it for declaring 
                 dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets 
                 you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. 
                 The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, 
                 readable, and quick to develop. Other frameworks deal 
                 with HTMLâ€™s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, 
                 CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way 
                 for manipulating the DOM. </p>

            <h3>Html</h3>
            <p>Every webpage you look at is written in a language 
                called HTML. You can think of HTML as the skeleton that 
                gives every webpage structure. In this course, we'll 
                use HTML to add paragraphs, headings, images and links 
                to a webpage.In the editor to the right, there's a tab 
                called test.html. This is the file we'll type our HTML into. 
                See the code with the s? That's HTML! Like any language, 
                it has its own special syntax (rules for communicating.

           <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used 
               to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML 
               or XML  CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, 
               paper, in speech, or on other media.CSS is one of the 
               core languages of the open web and is standardized across 
               browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed 
               in levels,and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is
